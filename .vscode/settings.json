	// Configure [glob patterns](https://aka.ms/vscode-glob-patterns) for excluding files and folders. For example, the File Explorer decides which files and folders to show or hide based on this setting. Refer to the `search.exclude#` setting to define search-specific excludes. Refer to the `#explorer.excludeGitIgnore` setting for ignoring files based on your `.gitignore`.
